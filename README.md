# Face_Detection_Classification_MA
Mini project as part of ME. 
This project presents a deep learning-based facial expression detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in PyTorch. The model is trained on grayscale images to classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more. It uses data augmentation, class balancing, and early stopping to improve accuracy and generalization. The system demonstrates strong performance in recognizing human emotions, with potential applications in healthcare, education, security, and human-computer interaction.
